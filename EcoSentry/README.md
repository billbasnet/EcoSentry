# EcoSentry: AI-Powered Forest Fire Prediction & Prevention System

## Overview
EcoSentry is an innovative solution designed to predict, detect, and help prevent forest fires using artificial intelligence. By leveraging satellite imagery, weather data, and machine learning algorithms, EcoSentry provides early warnings and resource optimization recommendations to help combat the growing threat of wildfires due to climate change.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts high-risk fire zones based on historical data, weather patterns, and vegetation conditions
- **Early Detection**: Uses computer vision on satellite imagery to detect fires in their earliest stages
- **Resource Optimization**: Recommends optimal allocation of firefighting resources
- **Community Alerts**: Provides timely warnings to at-risk communities

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js for mapping
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, GDAL
- **ML Models**: CNN for image analysis, Random Forest and XGBoost for predictive analytics
- **APIs**: Weather data, satellite imagery
